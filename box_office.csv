It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.",14.319742999999999,/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg,12/26/59,212.0,Released,The entertainment experience of a lifetime.,Ben-Hur,"[{'id': 3035, 'name': 'roman'}, {'id': 3071, 'name': 'prince'}, {'id': 3339, 'name': 'chariot race'}, {'id': 3575, 'name': 'jerusalem'}, {'id': 5744, 'name': 'governor'}, {'id': 6078, 'name': 'politics'}, {'id': 6917, 'name': 'epic'}, {'id': 9713, 'name': 'friends'}, {'id': 9748, 'name': 'revenge'}, {'id': 11508, 'name': 'jewish'}, {'id': 154820, 'name': 'galley'}, {'id': 192491, 'name': 'galley slave'}]",146900000,0,0,4,Action Adventure Drama History,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,6,31,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,3,23,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,4,6,12,4,3,4,2,6,2,0,0

Ilya is a character close to the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" clich√©. Homer feels Ilya's life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion story.  The film stars Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin, and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including dance, music, and language (through the use of subtitles). The signature song and the bouzouki theme of the movie became hits of the 1960s and brought the composer, Manos Hadjidakis, an Academy Award.",1.879162,/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg,5/24/60,91.0,Released,The Happy Street-Walker of Piraeus...,Never on Sunday,"[{'id': 549, 'name': 'prostitute'}, {'id': 1200, 'name': 'greece'}]",8000000,0,0,3,Comedy Drama Romance,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Little Joe's wife, the God-fearing Petunia Jackson, prays not only for her husband's mortal life, but also his eternal soul as she's afraid that if he dies now, he, despite not being an evil man, won't make it into heaven. As Little Joe is close to death, he is visited by agents of both the Lord and of Lucifer. They make a deal with him: they will give him six months to atone for the errors of his human life. Once back on Earth, he won't remember the deal but both the Lord and Lucifer will be watching over him, trying to get him to see things their way. As both sides try to get Little Joe's soul, they figure that some of the most powerful tools they have at their disposal are the women in Little Joe's life: Petunia on behalf of the Lord, and Georgia Brown, a gold-digging floozy, on behalf of Lucifer.",1.2334459999999998,/6e44tDPJzPtYOXVhPBxlVytTe5X.jpg,4/9/43,98.0,Released,At Last on the Screen!

He spends the night with a cinema cashier, whom he afterwards kills. Although a type of detective film, it is more slow moving and contemplative than other films of the genre. It explores the monotony of the murderer's existence and, like many of Wenders' films, the overwhelming cultural influence of America in post-war West Germany.",0.769053,/9KicBiKkg6h8dyKM4BBeD3Jy9nt.jpg,2/19/72,101.0,Released,,The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,"[{'id': 6075, 'name': 'sport'}]",100,0,0,2,Crime Drama,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
